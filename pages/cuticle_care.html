            <h2>How to Treat the Cuticle?</h2>
            <hr>
            <article>
                <img class="float-end border m-2 w-25" src="../images/manicure.jpg">
                <p class="lead">Soak the Cuticles</p>
                <p>As you know, cuticles are easiest reshaped, trimmed, and cared for when they are soft and pliable. Thatâ€™s why soaking them is essential before beginning the cuticle care process. Dry cuticles can be difficult to push back and may seem
                    thicker and be more difficult to trim. Tending to cuticles when dry could cause damage and pain, creating an unpleasant experience for the client. Soak the nails for a few minutes to soften the cuticles in preparation for the manicure
                    process. A scented nail soak is also calming, adding a feel of pampering to the nail service. Clients enjoy feeling pampered and cared for in a relaxed inviting environment.</p>
                <p class="lead">Apply Cuticle Oil</p>
                <p>Cuticle oil is essential in moisturizing the nail bed, cuticle, and preventing damaged, dry cuticles. Cuticle oil ingredients usually consist of essential oils or scented oils, vitamins, and citric acid. These ingredients work together
                    to provide healing benefits to the cuticles and nails. Daily environmental elements such as soaps, heat, chlorine, and salt expose cuticles, causing dryness and cracking. Cuticle oil restores moisturization to the nails and prevents
                    this damage from occurring. Massaging cuticle oil in a circular motion during application can increase blood circulation and encourage healthy nail growth. Cuticle oil application also promotes a healthy nail plate by preventing infection.
                    It also nourishes the delicate skin around the nail area, offering a softer, more silky feel.</p>
                <p class="lead">Push the Cuticles Back</p>
                <p>After the nails and cuticles have been soaked and aptly moisturized, gently push back the cuticles around each nail with a cuticle pusher or orange stick to reveal the excess cuticle skin. This excess skin is the skin available to be trimmed.
                    When pushing the cuticle back, make sure to hold the cuticle pusher parallel against the nail and gently push back. By keeping the tool parallel, you are preventing a downward angle push that can damage the nail matrix, thus damaging
                    the nail plate. Always be aware of the angle you are holding the cuticle pusher tool against the nail plate. After pushing the cuticles back, flip the cuticle pusher tool to the other end and use the smaller side to gently scrape away
                    any excess tissue in the corners around the nail.</p>
                <p class="lead">Trim Excess Cuticles</p>
                <p>Your clients may not realize that the eponychium (the large fold of skin around the nail) should not be removed entirely. This part of the skin is living; therefore, it will bleed if it is improperly trimmed. This improper removal can
                    cause infection to the skin and nails. After pushing the cuticles back, you will notice excess dried skin flaking above the eponychium. This skin is the cuticle that is available for removal. Simply clip this dead skin away with the
                    cuticle nippers using slow motion, never leaving sight of the nipper blades. You ensure a clean, straight edge for nail acrylics, gel, and polish applications by trimming excess cuticles.</p>
