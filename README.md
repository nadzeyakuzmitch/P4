# Nadzeya Nails Website | IS 117 Project Part 4 Fall 2021

In this project we had a task to create our own website based on the knowledge we got in the class. We were also instructed to use Bootstrap library to implement menus, footer and other styles, like cards and layouts. 

Most of the website is written using preprogrammed Bootstrap classes. It includes classes with simple CSS properties for positioning, text alignment, coloring, typography and many others. It was convenient to use them, because they 100% match the styles we are usually writing and with the help of the individual predefined classes I was able to reduce my own CSS file sizes to the minimum.

The only thing I would love to learn in the future is SCSS, because it provides an ability to create your own variables with predefined styles, as well as it allows to override standard Bootstrap styles, like colors, so you could globally change your website's theme.

Bootstrap is a great framework, which allows you to build your website from scratch using a list of organized properties but without fully using a huge templates that are hard to customize (like WordPress).
